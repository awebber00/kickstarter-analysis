# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client Louise wants to know how campaigns similar to hers have fared trend-wise in relation to their respective launch dates and funding goals. The purpose of this report is to analyze Kickstarter data to discover trends and produce a detailed perspective on how different variables may affect certain outcomes for our client in the future. Charts and graphs will be used to convey these findings to the client. These charts and graphs will aid in telling the complete story on how we arrived at our findings and how they can be of use to the client in their future endeavors.
